# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest release receives security fixes.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| 1.x (macOS and Windows) | ✅ |
| older | ❌ |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security problems.**

Use GitHub's private reporting: **Security → Report a vulnerability** on
<https://github.com/Slipcast-dev/Grizzly/security/advisories/new>.

Include the affected version and platform, steps to reproduce (a sample file helps), and the impact you expect.
You can expect an acknowledgement within 7 days. Fixes are released as a new version and credited in the
advisory unless you prefer to stay anonymous.

## Scope

In scope: crashes or code execution triggered by a crafted document, path or encoding handling bugs, weaknesses in
the Electron configuration (sandbox, preload bridge, CSP), and problems in the build scripts.

Out of scope: the lack of Apple notarization / Windows code signing (known and documented), and issues that
require an attacker who already controls the user's machine.

## Verifying downloads

Every release lists SHA-256 checksums. Verify them before running a downloaded file — see
[docs/en/installation.md](docs/en/installation.md).
