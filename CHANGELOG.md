# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-27

### Fixed
- A new sidebar folder is now created when the name field loses focus (not only on Return); previously an unconfirmed name vanished when switching sections, and the folder could not be opened, renamed, deleted or receive files.
- Clicking a folder row anywhere expands or collapses it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-27

### Added
- Toolbar **Open** button (menu: open file, add folder from disk).
- Folders from disk: files of a directory and its subdirectories are added to the sidebar; "Refresh from folder" and "Show in Finder" in the folder menu; folders can be dropped into the window.
- Quick Look: Space or the context menu previews a sidebar file without opening it (system Quick Look on macOS, a text preview on Windows).

### Fixed
- Sidebar rows now react to clicks on the file name, not only at the row edges.
- Folder context menu (rename, delete) works on the whole folder row.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-27

First public release.
