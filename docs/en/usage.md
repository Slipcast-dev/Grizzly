# User guide

## Opening files

- `⌘O` / `Ctrl+O`, or drag files onto the window or the Dock / taskbar icon.
- **From Finder (macOS)**: double-click a file or use *Open With → Grizzly*. If Grizzly is not running it starts with the file; if it is, the file opens as a tab in the existing window (never a second window or a second copy of the app). To make it the default app, see *Settings → File types*.
- Several files open as tabs. `⇧⌘]` / `⇧⌘[` (`Ctrl+Shift+]` / `[`) cycle through them.
- Supported extensions: `md markdown mdown txt text log json yaml yml csv tsv xml html htm ini conf toml tex rtf`,
  plus source code: `py pyw swift c h cpp cc cxx hpp hh hxx cs js mjs cjs jsx ts tsx css scss php`.
  Anything unknown opens as plain text.

## New file

`⌘N` / `Ctrl+N` (or the *New File* button in the sidebar next to *New Folder*) asks for a name, folder and format in the save dialog, creates the file with a
small starter template (a heading for Markdown, `{}` for JSON, a header row for CSV, a skeleton for HTML, C/C++, C#, PHP and so on) and opens it in a new tab in
edit mode. Existing files are replaced only after the system dialog's confirmation.

## Modes

**macOS: two modes, shown as two buttons in the title bar (and in the header of each pane in split view).**

| Mode | Shortcut | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| **User** | `⌥⌘1` | Edit the text with the formatting code hidden: it looks the way it reads |
| **Developer** | `⌥⌘2` | The file exactly as it is: all the markup, line numbers, bookmarks and syntax colors |

Both modes edit the same file; save with `⌘S`. CSV files are shown as a table in User mode. In split view every pane has its own mode (the right
one starts as Developer), so you can type code on one side and see the result on the other; drag the divider between the panes to change their widths
(a double click makes them equal).

**Windows: three modes** — **Reading** (`Ctrl+Alt+1`, rendered Markdown, CSV tables), **Source** (`Ctrl+Alt+2`, raw text with line numbers, bookmarks and syntax colors)
and **Edit** (`Ctrl+Alt+3`, change the text and save with `Ctrl+S`).

Saving writes the text back in the encoding the file was read with; a UTF-8 BOM is kept.

## Markdown

Headings, emphasis, inline code, fenced code blocks, ordered / unordered lists, task lists (`- [x]`), block quotes,
tables and links are rendered in the current theme. Open [`samples/README.md`](../../samples/README.md) for an example.

## Other formats

| Type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| CSV / TSV | Shown as a table; the delimiter (`,` `;` tab) is detected automatically |
| Python, Swift, C / C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, PHP | Syntax colors in the source views (and live while editing on macOS); comments and strings spanning lines are supported. Fenced Markdown blocks (```` ```python ````) use the same colors |
| JSON, YAML, INI / conf / TOML | Syntax colors in source mode |
| XML / HTML | Shown as source with syntax colors (HTML is never executed) |
| TeX | Syntax colors |
| Log | Errors, warnings and successes are highlighted |
| RTF | Converted to plain text |

## Bookmarks

In source mode, click a line number to toggle an orange bookmark. Bookmarks are remembered per file between sessions.
The line-number gutter can be turned off in Settings.

## Find

`⌘F` / `Ctrl+F` opens the find bar; matches are highlighted as you type. `⌘G` / `Ctrl+G` goes to the next match,
`⇧⌘G` / `Ctrl+Shift+G` to the previous one (Windows also accepts `F3` / `Shift+F3`). `Esc` closes the bar.

Hits are highlighted in the text you are editing.

## Select all and copy

`⌘A` / `Ctrl+A` selects the whole document and `⌘C` / `Ctrl+C` copies all of it.

## Search files, tags

The sidebar field **Search files** matches the beginning of a file or folder name, or of any word in it ("gri" finds "My Grizzly notes.md"). Typing `#work` searches tags.

**Tags** live at the bottom of the sidebar. Create one with **+**, assign it from a file's context menu (*Tags*), rename or delete it from the tag's context menu. Tags are the `#words` you write in a Markdown / text file: they are colored in the text, a click on one lists the files that carry it, and typing `#` suggests the known tags. In the sidebar, click a tag to filter, click more tags to narrow the list (files must carry all of them), or *All Tags* to reset. *Rename* and *Delete* in a tag's context menu also change the text of every file that uses it (RTF files and files with unsaved edits are skipped).

## Spelling and grammar

While you edit, Markdown, TXT, RTF and TeX files are checked in Russian and English; mistakes are underlined and corrections are in the context menu (macOS also checks grammar). Switch it off in *Settings → Text*. Source code is never checked. On Windows the dictionaries are downloaded by the system on first use.

## Emoji

The 😀 button in the toolbar opens the system emoji picker (`⌃⌘Space` on macOS, `Win+.` on Windows). If a file is in an 8-bit encoding (Windows-1251, ISO-8859-1) that cannot hold emoji, Grizzly offers to save it as UTF-8.

Tag names may contain emoji (`#🍕`). A tag typed into the text appears in the sidebar after a short pause, without saving.

## Unsaved changes

Closing a tab or the window with unsaved edits asks whether to save, discard or cancel.

## Undo, Save and notifications

Above the editor the *Undo* button (top right) reverts one step at a time (a word, a deletion, a paste) and *Save* writes the file. Short pop-up notifications confirm actions such as saving, copying all text, creating a file, reloading, and changing tags, bookmarks or favorites.

## Updates

*Settings → Updates → Check for Updates* looks for a newer release on GitHub. If there is one, Grizzly downloads and installs it (verifying the SHA-256 from the release notes) and restarts. After the restart your tabs, split view, mode and scroll position are restored. The check also runs silently at every launch. On macOS the app must be in a folder you can write to (normally *Applications*).

## Two files side by side

`⌘\` / `Ctrl+\` splits the window into two panes so you can compare or cross-reference two documents. Press it again to go back.

## Save As

The **Save As…** button in the sidebar action row (`⇧⌘S` / `Ctrl+Shift+S`) saves a **copy** of the current file, including unsaved edits, to a place you choose.
The name field starts with the file name **without an extension**. Pick the format in the dialog (Markdown, Text, JSON, YAML, CSV, TSV, Log, XML, HTML, INI/TOML, TeX, RTF); it is appended when you save. An extension you type yourself wins.
The text is not converted between formats, only the file type changes. The source encoding is kept; if it cannot hold some characters the copy is written in UTF-8, and RTF sources are saved as UTF-8 text.
The open document is not changed. *Save* (`⌘S`) still writes edits back to the original file.

## Library

The sidebar holds a **virtual library**: your own folders and favorites (⭐), plus the history of opened files on the clock tab. It is only a list of
references and tags — it never moves or copies your files. (The one thing that edits files is *Rename tag* / *Delete tag*, which rewrites `#tag` in the text of files that use it, after a confirmation.)

- **New folder** (the folder button in the sidebar header): type a name and press Return (leaving the field also saves it). Drag files onto a folder to move them; right-click a folder to rename or delete it.
- The sidebar has one row of equal buttons: **New File**, **Open File**, **New Folder** (virtual) and **Save As…**. *File → Add Folder from Disk…* (`⇧⌘O` / `Ctrl+Shift+O`) adds a whole folder from disk (subfolders become sidebar folders; use
  *Refresh from folder* in its menu to pick up new files). Dropping a folder into the window does the same.
- **History** (the clock tab): every file you open is recorded there, newest first. Removing a file from the library does **not** remove it from the history; opening it from there shows it in a tab without putting it back in the sidebar. Right-click an entry to remove it, or use *Clear* to empty the list.
- **Quick Look**: select a file in the sidebar and press Space (or use the context menu) to preview it without opening a tab.

## Preview in Finder and default app (macOS)

- **Finder preview**: with the *Grizzly Quick Look* extension enabled (see the installation guide), pressing Space on a Markdown, YAML, CSV/TSV or log file shows it formatted without opening Grizzly.
- **Default app**: *Settings → File types* lists the supported extensions. Click one to open such files in Grizzly by default, use *Make Grizzly the default app for all*, or type your own extension (e.g. `py`). A checkmark means Grizzly is already the default; macOS may ask you to confirm.

Where it is stored:

| Platform | Location |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Grizzly/library.json` |
| Windows | `GrizzlyData\library.json` next to the .exe (or `%APPDATA%\Grizzly`) |

## Live reload

When a file changes on disk (a build script, a sync tool, an AI assistant), Grizzly shows a banner. Click it or press
`⌘R` / `Ctrl+R` to reload. With *auto reload* enabled in Settings the file refreshes itself; text you are editing is
never overwritten without asking.

## Appearance

Open Settings (`⌘,` / `Ctrl+,`):

- **Appearance:** follow system, light or dark.
- **Sections:** Appearance, Text, Syntax highlighting, Files, Language and (macOS) File types are listed on the left; the window can be resized in both directions.
- **Syntax highlighting:** one switch for everything and a switch per language (Settings → Syntax highlighting).
- **Theme:** Xcode, GitHub, Solarized, Dracula, Monokai, Nord, One Dark. Themes without a light variant stay dark in light mode.
- **Font** and **size** (`⌘+` / `⌘-` while reading), heading spacing (compact / normal / spacious).
- **Language:** *Settings → Language* switches between *Follow System*, Русский and English. On first launch the interface follows the system language (Russian on a Russian system, English otherwise). On macOS the app offers to restart after a change; on Windows it switches instantly.

## Formatting (Markdown)

The bar above the editor (and the *Format* menu) writes plain Markdown: `# Title`, `## Heading`, `### Subheading`, `**bold**`,
`*italic*`, `<u>underline</u>`, `~~strikethrough~~`, `<mark class="mint">highlight</mark>` (violet, pink, orange, mint, blue),
`<div align="center">…</div>` for alignment, `* ` bullets, `- ` dashes, `1. ` numbers, `- [ ] ` check lists, `> ` quotes, `---` dividers
and `| a | b |` tables. In User mode (the code above is hidden there; Developer mode shows it) the arrow next to a Title or Heading folds its section, and the circle of a check list item can
be ticked (the file is saved). Folders can be nested; *Open* accepts a folder and adds it to the sidebar with its supported files.

**Attachments.** The paperclip button (or *Format → Insert*, or the right-click menu, or drag and drop, or paste) adds a photo, video, PDF, any file or a link to a web page. Files are copied to `<name>.assets` next to the document and written as `![name](Notes.assets/photo.png)` or `[name](Notes.assets/paper.pdf)`. In split view each pane has its own mode and the divider between them can be dragged.
