**Grizzly** is a small reader and editor for Markdown, plain-text and source-code files (with syntax highlighting for Python, Swift,
C/C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS and PHP). It opens a document, shows it the way you
would like to read it, lets you format it without seeing a line of markup, and gets out of the way. The macOS app is native
(SwiftUI); the Windows app is a portable Electron port (see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for what is macOS-only).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The builds are **not code-signed or notarized**. macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen will warn on first
> launch. See [Installation](docs/en/installation.md) for the exact steps, and verify the SHA-256 checksums
> published in the release notes before running anything you downloaded.

## Features

- **User and Developer modes** (macOS) — *User* edits the text with the formatting code hidden: it looks the way it reads (headings, bold, lists with real markers, clickable check boxes, quotes, dividers, bordered tables, folding sections). *Developer* shows the file exactly as it is: all the markup, line numbers, clickable line **bookmarks** (kept between sessions) and syntax colors for **Python, Swift, C/C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS and PHP** (also inside fenced Markdown blocks) as well as JSON, YAML, INI/TOML, XML/HTML, TeX and logs. In split view each pane has its own mode, and the divider between the panes can be dragged. (Windows: Reading / Source / Edit.)
- **Formatting** (macOS, Markdown) — a bar, a *Format* menu and the right-click menu: Title / Heading / Subheading / Body / Monospaced, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, five soft highlight colors, alignment, bulleted / dashed / numbered lists, check lists, quotes, dividers and tables. The file stays plain Markdown.
- **Attachments** (macOS) — photos, videos, PDF files, any files and links to web pages: from the paperclip, by drag and drop or by pasting a picture. Files are copied next to the document into `<name>.assets`.
- **New file** — `⌘N` / `Ctrl+N`: pick a name, folder and format; the file is created with a small template and opens for editing.
- **Saving keeps the file as it was** — the original encoding (UTF-8 with/without BOM, UTF-16, Windows-1251,
  ISO-8859-1) is preserved (a file that cannot hold emoji is offered UTF-8). *Undo* steps back one word at a time; spelling and grammar are checked in Russian and English (Markdown, TXT, RTF, TeX).
- **CSV / TSV tables** with automatic delimiter detection.
- **Save As…** — save a copy in any supported format and location, without touching the original.
- **Find** with live highlighting, next / previous match.
- **Search files** by the beginning of a name or of any word in it (files and folders).
- **Tags like in Apple Notes** — `#hashtags` (emoji allowed) written in a file are its tags: colored in the text, suggested while typing, listed in the sidebar; click one or several to list the files that carry them; rename or delete a tag everywhere.
- **Notifications** for saving, copying, tags and other actions; an emoji picker button.
- **Updates** — *Settings → Updates* checks GitHub (also at every launch) and installs a new version from inside the app.
- **Tabs** and **two files side by side**.
- **Virtual library** — folders (also inside folders; open a whole folder or pick several rows at once) and favorites that never touch your files (only renaming or deleting a tag edits the text of files that use it, after a confirmation), plus an open history that survives removing a file from the sidebar.
- **Live reload** — a banner appears when the file changes on disk (handy for files written by scripts or AI tools).
- **7 themes** (Xcode, GitHub, Solarized, Dracula, Monokai, Nord, One Dark), light / dark / follow system, the glass effect of macOS with adjustable
  transparency, 16 built-in fonts (Cyrillic included) and a font and size of its own for the interface.
- **Quick Look in Finder** (macOS) — press Space on Markdown, YAML, CSV or log files to preview them without opening Grizzly.
- **Default app picker** (macOS) — Settings → File types makes Grizzly the default app for chosen extensions.
- **English and Russian** interface.

Supported extensions: `md markdown mdown txt text log json yaml yml csv tsv xml html htm ini conf toml tex rtf` and source code: `py pyw swift c h cpp cc cxx hpp hh hxx cs js mjs cjs jsx ts tsx css scss php`.

## Privacy and security

Grizzly has no telemetry and no accounts. Its only network access is the update check against the public GitHub Releases API (at launch and from *Settings → Updates*); a download is installed only from GitHub over HTTPS and is verified against the SHA-256 in the release notes (a release without one is refused). The Windows app runs its UI in a
sandboxed renderer with context isolation and a strict Content-Security-Policy. Report vulnerabilities
privately — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Build from source

```bash
# macOS (Command Line Tools are enough)
./scripts/build-app.sh && ./scripts/make-dmg.sh

# Windows port (Electron)
cd electron && npm ci && npm run dist
```
